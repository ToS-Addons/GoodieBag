# GoodieBag

Open Source Game Addon Manager

## Introduction

Addons for computer games are a way of enhancing a game's experience by the means of voluntary software development without necessarily compromising the terms and conditions of the respective game. Some games even encourage the development of such tools by featuring a rich set of functions, data and documentation about writing addons. Interestingly enough, there is no real Open Source solution for the management of such addons although the addons themselves are almost always Open Source or at least free software. GoodieBag tries to fill this gap by providing the platform both for developers and end users to distribute, install and update addons with ease as well as maintaining bootstrap libraries, dependencies and providing compatibility checks to ensure smooth operation of the game's addons.

## Project Status

The project is currently in a concept phase and a very limited prototype (Version 0.1) will be released for the game "Tree of Savior" probably Mid-April 2016. Expect a lot of features to be either missing or hardcoded.

If you are a developer, check [the wiki](https://github.com/ToS-Addons/GoodieBag/wiki) for information how GoodieBag will work. The mentioned publishing tool will probably not make it until the first beta version.
